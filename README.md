## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Responsive Design: Implementing a layout that adapts to different screen sizes was crucial. Utilizing CSS media queries enabled me to tailor the interface for optimal viewing across devices, emphasizing the project's goal for a universally accessible user interface.

Interactivity: Enhancing user experience through interactive elements like hover and focus states for buttons and links. This aspect of the challenge pushed me to delve into CSS properties that enhance usability and engagement.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 525px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
}
```

This project was a step forward in my journey as a developer, offering practical experience in responsive web design and the importance of user-centered design principles.
